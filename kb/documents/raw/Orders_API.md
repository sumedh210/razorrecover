# Orders

You can create [Orders](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/orders.md) and link them to payments. Orders APIs are used to create, update and retrieve details of Orders. Also, you can retrieve details of payments made towards these Orders.

Fork the Razorpay Postman Public Workspace and try the Orders APIs using your [Test API Keys](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys).

### Errors

The API `` provided is invalid.

* solution: Pass `count` as a positive integer between 1 and 100.

The count may not be greater than 100.
* code: 400
* description: `count` value above 100 in the query string. The Orders list endpoint caps per-page results at 100.

The count must be an integer.
* code: 400
